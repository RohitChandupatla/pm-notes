## What is a project life cycle?<br>
A project life cycle is a collection of project phases that defines<br>
what work will be performed in each phase<br>
what deliverables will be produced and when<br>
who is involved in each phase, and<br>
how management will control and approve work produced in each phase<br>

## What is the difference between project and product?<br>
 It is good practice to divide projects into several phases
Because projects operate as part of a system and involve uncertainty<br>
 The same can be said for developing products
